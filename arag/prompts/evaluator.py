## Few-Shot Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**
<query>What are the primary causes and environmental impacts of ocean acidification?</query>

<knowledge_chunks>
{0}----------------------
Ocean acidification is primarily caused by the absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) by seawater. When CO2 dissolves in seawater, it forms carbonic acid (H2CO3), which releases hydrogen ions, thereby increasing acidity and lowering the ocean's pH level. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the ocean has absorbed approximately 30% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, resulting in a 0.1 unit decrease in surface ocean pH, equivalent to a 30% increase in acidity.
{1}----------------------
The environmental impacts of ocean acidification are widespread and concerning. The most documented effect is on calcifying organisms such as corals, mollusks, and certain plankton species that build shells or skeletons from calcium carbonate. Increased acidity reduces the availability of carbonate ions necessary for these structures, making it more difficult or energetically costly for these organisms to build and maintain their shells or skeletons. In severe cases, existing calcium carbonate structures can begin to dissolve.
{2}----------------------
Beyond calcifying organisms, acidification affects marine ecosystems through food web disruptions. For example, pteropods (small sea snails) are a key food source for many fish species, including salmon. As pteropods struggle to form shells in more acidic conditions, their populations may decline, potentially leading to cascading effects throughout marine food webs. Additionally, some studies suggest that increased CO2 levels can affect the behavior of certain fish species, altering their sensory abilities and decision-making processes.
</knowledge_chunks>

<answer>
Ocean acidification happens when the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This has been happening since the Industrial Revolution began, with the ocean absorbing about 30% of human-caused CO2 emissions. This absorption has led to a 0.1 decrease in ocean pH, which means a 30% increase in acidity.

The main impact of ocean acidification is on sea creatures that build shells or skeletons using calcium carbonate. As the water becomes more acidic, it's harder for these organisms to build their structures, and in some cases, existing shells can actually start to dissolve. This affects corals, mollusks, and some types of plankton.

There are also broader ecosystem effects. Small sea snails called pteropods are important food for many fish, including salmon. As acidification makes it harder for pteropods to form shells, their numbers might drop, which could affect many other species in the food chain. Some research also shows that higher CO2 levels in water can change how fish behave and make decisions.

**Output:**
```
Needs_Improvement: False

Improvement_Areas:
1. Include the chemical process of CO2 forming carbonic acid which releases hydrogen ions

### Example 2
**Input:**
<query>Explain the main features and benefits of the new healthcare policy.</query>

<knowledge_chunks>
{0}----------------------
The Healthcare Enhancement and Accessibility Reform (HEAR) Act introduces comprehensive coverage for preventive care services, including annual wellness visits, vaccinations, and screening tests, all available without copayments or deductibles. This approach is designed to encourage early detection and treatment of health conditions, potentially reducing long-term healthcare costs and improving population health outcomes.
{1}----------------------
A significant component of the HEAR Act is the expansion of telehealth services coverage. The policy mandates insurance reimbursement for virtual consultations at the same rate as in-person visits and provides subsidies for broadband access in underserved communities. Studies suggest that enhanced telehealth access could particularly benefit rural communities, where the average travel distance to healthcare facilities exceeds 30 miles for approximately 15% of residents.
{2}----------------------
The HEAR Act establishes a prescription drug price negotiation mechanism for Medicare, potentially reducing medication costs for seniors by an estimated 15-30% for commonly prescribed treatments. Additionally, the Act caps annual out-of-pocket prescription expenses at $2,000 for Medicare beneficiaries, providing financial predictability for individuals managing chronic conditions.
{3}----------------------
Critics of the HEAR Act have raised concerns about implementation costs, estimated at $340 billion over the next decade. The Congressional Budget Office projects that while the Act may increase federal deficits in the short term, improved preventive care and reduced hospitalizations could result in net savings of approximately $125 billion over a 20-year period. However, these long-term projections remain contested by some health economists.
</knowledge_chunks>

<answer>
The Healthcare Enhancement and Accessibility Reform (HEAR) Act contains several important features. First, it provides full coverage for preventive services with no copays or deductibles, including yearly checkups, vaccines, and health screenings. This focus on prevention helps catch health problems early.

The policy also expands telehealth services, requiring insurance companies to pay for virtual appointments at the same rate as in-person visits. It includes broadband subsidies for underserved areas. This is especially helpful for rural communities where about 15% of people live more than 30 miles from healthcare facilities.

For seniors on Medicare, the HEAR Act creates a system to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, which could reduce medication costs by 15-30%. It also puts a $2,000 yearly cap on out-of-pocket prescription expenses for Medicare patients.

While the program is expected to cost $340 billion over ten years, the Congressional Budget Office believes it will save around $125 billion over twenty years through better preventive care and fewer hospitalizations. However, some health economists disagree with these long-term savings projections.
</answer>

**Output:**
```
Needs_Improvement: True

Improvement_Areas:
1. Explicitly state the intended benefits of preventive care (reducing long-term costs and improving health outcomes)
2. Add an introductory sentence summarizing the HEAR Act and a conclusion that synthesizes benefits
3. Clarify what "underserved areas" means regarding broadband subsidies
4. Better integrate balanced perspectives throughout rather than presenting criticisms at the end only

### Example 3
**Input:**
<query>Describe the causes, symptoms, and treatments for seasonal affective disorder.</query>

<knowledge_chunks>
{0}----------------------
Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is primarily caused by changes in exposure to natural light that occur with seasonal transitions, particularly during fall and winter when daylight hours diminish. The reduced sunlight exposure can disrupt the body's internal clock (circadian rhythm), leading to hormonal imbalances. Specifically, these changes can affect the production of melatonin, which regulates sleep, and serotonin, a neurotransmitter that influences mood. Individuals with a family history of depression or those living in northern latitudes where seasonal light variations are more extreme have an increased risk of developing SAD.
{1}----------------------
The symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder typically emerge in a seasonal pattern, most commonly beginning in late fall or early winter and resolving during spring and summer months. Common symptoms include persistent low mood, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, fatigue and low energy despite increased sleep duration, difficulty concentrating, and changes in appetite—particularly cravings for carbohydrate-rich foods—that may lead to weight gain. Some individuals may experience irritability, heightened sensitivity to rejection, and increased desire to avoid social situations. While less common, a spring/summer pattern of SAD exists, characterized by insomnia, decreased appetite, and anxiety.
{2}----------------------
Treatment approaches for Seasonal Affective Disorder include light therapy (phototherapy), which involves daily exposure to a special bright light box that mimics natural outdoor light. This therapy is typically recommended for 20-30 minutes each morning during affected seasons and works by suppressing melatonin production and regulating circadian rhythms. Antidepressant medications, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may be prescribed for moderate to severe cases. Psychotherapy, especially cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can help individuals identify negative thought patterns and develop coping strategies. Lifestyle modifications such as increasing outdoor time, regular exercise, maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, and vitamin D supplementation may also provide symptomatic relief.
{3}----------------------
Prevention strategies for those with a history of SAD include proactive light therapy beginning in early fall before symptoms typically emerge, planning outdoor activities during daylight hours, and arranging living and working spaces to maximize natural light exposure. Some patients benefit from a combination of approaches tailored to their specific symptom patterns and severity. While most cases can be effectively managed with appropriate treatment, untreated SAD can lead to complications including social withdrawal, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation, underscoring the importance of professional assessment and timely intervention.
</knowledge_chunks>

<answer>
Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that happens at specific times of the year, usually during winter. It's caused by reduced sunlight in fall and winter months, which can mess up your body's internal clock and lead to feeling depressed.

People with SAD usually feel sad, low on energy, and sleep more than usual. They might also gain weight and crave carbs. These symptoms typically start in the fall and go away in spring.

There are several treatments that can help with SAD. Light therapy uses a special bright light box that you sit near each morning. Some people take antidepressants, and talk therapy can also help. Making lifestyle changes like getting outside more during daylight, exercising, and keeping a regular sleep schedule can make symptoms better too.

<query>How does artificial intelligence impact privacy and security?</query>

<knowledge_chunks>
{0}----------------------
Artificial intelligence technologies present significant privacy implications through their data requirements and surveillance capabilities. Machine learning systems typically require massive datasets for training, which often contain personal information collected without meaningful consent. Facial recognition AI systems deployed in public spaces can track individuals without their knowledge, with studies showing error rates as high as 35% for darker-skinned females compared to 1% for lighter-skinned males. Voice recognition systems continuously process speech, potentially capturing sensitive conversations. These privacy concerns are magnified by AI's ability to correlate multiple data sources, revealing insights about individuals beyond what any single dataset would show.
{1}----------------------
AI offers powerful security benefits including enhanced threat detection and automated response capabilities. Advanced anomaly detection algorithms can identify potential intrusions that would escape human analysts, with leading systems demonstrating 87% accuracy in detecting zero-day attacks. AI-powered security applications can analyze network traffic patterns to identify malicious activity in real-time, responding 70% faster than manual intervention. Conversely, AI also enables sophisticated security threats through deepfakes, automated phishing, and intelligent malware that adapts to defense mechanisms. Criminal actors increasingly deploy machine learning to create convincing social engineering attacks that dynamically adjust to victim responses, increasing successful compromise rates by approximately 30% in controlled studies.
{2}----------------------
The governance of AI privacy and security involves a complex balance between innovation, protection, and accountability. Current regulatory frameworks struggle with AI's technical complexity, with only 22% of global jurisdictions having AI-specific privacy legislation. Organizations implementing AI systems must consider privacy-by-design principles, robust security testing for AI vulnerabilities, and transparent data governance. Emerging technical solutions include federated learning (which keeps raw data on user devices), homomorphic encryption (allowing computation on encrypted data), and differential privacy (adding calibrated noise to protect individual records). These approaches can reduce privacy and security risks but often introduce computational overhead and accuracy trade-offs. The most effective governance approaches combine technical safeguards with appropriate regulatory oversight and ethical guidelines.
</knowledge_chunks>

<answer>
Artificial intelligence impacts privacy in several important ways. AI systems need huge amounts of data to learn properly, and this data often contains personal information. Many times, this information is collected without people really understanding or agreeing to it. AI technologies like facial recognition can track people in public without their knowledge, and these systems don't work equally well for everyone - they're much less accurate for women with darker skin.

For security, AI offers both benefits and risks. On the positive side, AI can detect threats that humans might miss and respond to attacks much faster than manual methods. AI systems can analyze network traffic to identify suspicious activity in real-time. However, AI also enables new security threats like deepfakes (fake videos or audio that look real), smarter phishing attacks, and malware that can adapt to defenses. Criminals are using machine learning to create more convincing scams that adjust based on how people respond.

Managing these privacy and security challenges is difficult. Most countries don't have specific laws about AI privacy yet. Organizations using AI should build privacy protections into their systems from the start and test thoroughly for security weaknesses. There are some technical solutions being developed, like ways to train AI without sharing raw data and methods to compute on encrypted information, but these approaches often make systems slower or less accurate.
