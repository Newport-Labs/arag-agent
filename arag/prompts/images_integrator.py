{215}-------------------------------------------------
# **The Art of Sourdough Bread Making**

## Sourdough Starter Maintenance
A healthy starter is the foundation of good sourdough bread.

![](_page_215_Picture_1.jpeg)

Feed your starter regularly with equal weights of flour and water. A mature starter should double in volume within 4-8 hours after feeding.

![](_page_215_Picture_2.jpeg)

Look for a bubbly texture and pleasant, tangy aroma. The starter should float when a small amount is dropped in water, indicating it's ready to use.

{216}-------------------------------------------------
## Dough Mixing and Development
Proper mixing ensures even hydration and begins gluten development.

![](_page_216_Picture_1.jpeg)

Combine starter, flour, water, and salt according to your recipe. Initial mixing should incorporate all ingredients without overmixing.

![](_page_216_Picture_2.jpeg)

Develop gluten through stretch and fold techniques. Gently stretch the dough and fold it over itself, repeating from different directions.

{217}-------------------------------------------------
## Bulk Fermentation
This stage develops flavor and structure through controlled fermentation.

![](_page_217_Picture_1.jpeg)

The dough should increase in volume by 30-50% during bulk fermentation. Look for a domed surface with visible bubbles.

## Shaping Techniques
Proper shaping creates tension in the dough, supporting the loaf during baking.

![](_page_217_Picture_2.jpeg)

{218}-------------------------------------------------
Pre-shape the dough into a round by pulling the edges toward the center, creating a taut surface.

![](_page_218_Picture_1.jpeg)

After a brief rest, perform the final shaping. For a boule (round loaf), fold the edges toward the center, then roll to create tension.

## Proofing
Final proofing allows the shaped loaf to rise before baking.

![](_page_218_Picture_2.jpeg)

Proof in a basket or bowl lined with a well-floured cloth. The dough is ready when it springs back slowly when gently pressed.
