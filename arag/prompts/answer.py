## Few-Shot Examples

**Input:**
<user_query>What are the symptoms of Type 2 diabetes and how is it diagnosed?</user_query>
<document_chunks>
<document_chunk>
Type 2 diabetes often develops gradually with symptoms that may include increased thirst and frequent urination, fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing sores, frequent infections, and areas of darkened skin (usually in the armpits and neck).
</document_chunk>
<document_chunk>
Some patients remain asymptomatic in early stages, which is why regular screening is recommended for those with risk factors such as obesity, family history, or age over 45.
</document_chunk>
<document_chunk>
Diagnosis typically involves several blood tests: the A1C test measuring average blood sugar over 2-3 months (6.5% or higher indicates diabetes), fasting blood sugar tests (126 mg/dL or higher suggests diabetes), and the glucose tolerance test evaluating how your body processes sugar.
</document_chunk>
</document_chunks>

**Output:**
Type 2 diabetes is a prevalent metabolic condition that affects millions of people worldwide, often developing gradually over time. Recognizing its symptoms and understanding diagnostic approaches are crucial for early intervention and effective management of this chronic condition.

<user_query>What causes microservices to fail?</user_query>
<document_chunks>
<document_chunk>
Microservice architectures commonly fail due to several recurring issues: excessive inter-service communication creating network bottlenecks and latency; improper service boundaries leading to tight coupling and cascading failures; inadequate observability making troubleshooting nearly impossible; and inconsistent data management between services. Studies show that 78% of initial microservice implementations require significant architectural revisions within the first 18 months due to these fundamental design problems.
</document_chunk>
<document_chunk>
Successfully implementing microservices requires addressing common failure points through specific architectural practices. Teams should implement circuit breakers and bulkhead patterns to prevent cascading failures, design services around business domains rather than technical functions, establish comprehensive distributed tracing and centralized logging, and implement saga patterns or event sourcing for distributed data consistency. Organizations that invest in service mesh infrastructure report 65% fewer production incidents related to service-to-service communication. Regular chaos engineering exercises help identify resilience gaps before they affect users.
</document_chunk>
</document_chunks>

**Output:**
Microservice architectures have emerged as a powerful approach to building scalable, flexible applications that can evolve with changing business needs. However, despite their growing popularity, these distributed systems often encounter significant challenges that can lead to performance degradation or outright failure when not properly implemented.

### Key Failure Patterns in Microservice Architectures

Excessive inter-service communication is one of the most common causes of microservice failure. As services multiply, the network interactions between them can create significant bottlenecks, increased latency, and multiple points of failure that affect the entire system.

Improper service boundaries represent another critical vulnerability. When services aren't effectively isolated, tight coupling develops between supposedly independent components. This means changes to one service often require cascading changes to others, and failures can propagate throughout the system rather than remaining contained.

Troubleshooting distributed systems becomes particularly challenging without adequate observability infrastructure. The complexity of microservice environments can make it nearly impossible to isolate root causes when problems arise.

Data consistency also presents significant challenges across multiple services. Different components may hold conflicting versions of the same data, and transactions spanning multiple services become complex to manage correctly.

These fundamental design problems are remarkably common - research indicates that 78% of initial microservice implementations require significant architectural revisions within the first 18 months of deployment.

### Preventative Strategies and Solutions

Several established patterns can prevent cascading failures throughout a microservice architecture. Circuit breakers automatically detect failures and prevent repeat calls to failing services, while bulkhead patterns isolate components to contain failures within specific system boundaries.

Rather than organizing services around technical functions, successful microservice architectures organize around business domains. This approach aligns services with specific business capabilities and creates natural system boundaries that reflect divisions in the business.

Robust observability tools are essential for microservice success. Distributed tracing follows requests across multiple service boundaries, centralized logging aggregates information from all services for correlation, and comprehensive health metrics provide real-time visibility into service performance.

To manage data across distributed services, specific patterns have proven effective. The saga pattern coordinates transactions across multiple services using compensating actions, while event sourcing maintains a log of state changes rather than current state.

Organizations that invest in specialized infrastructure for microservices see significantly better outcomes. Service mesh implementations reduce production incidents related to service-to-service communication by 65%, while regular chaos engineering exercises proactively identify resilience gaps before they affect users.

Successful microservice implementation requires more than simply breaking a monolith into smaller pieces—it demands thoughtful architecture, specific resilience patterns, and specialized tooling. By understanding common failure modes and implementing proven preventative strategies, organizations can overcome the inherent challenges of distributed systems and realize the full benefits of microservice architectures.

<user_query>How do you treat poison ivy rash?</user_query>
<document_chunks>
<document_chunk>
Poison ivy rash treatment begins with immediately washing the affected skin with soap and lukewarm water to remove any remaining plant oil (urushiol). For mild cases, over-the-counter products like calamine lotion, hydrocortisone creams (1%), or oral antihistamines can relieve itching. Cool compresses applied for 15-30 minutes several times daily may reduce inflammation. Avoid scratching the rash as this can lead to infection.
</document_chunk>
<document_chunk>
For severe or widespread poison ivy reactions, medical attention may be necessary. Doctors typically prescribe stronger corticosteroids, either topical formulations for limited areas or oral steroids like prednisone for extensive rashes. In cases with signs of infection (increased pain, swelling, warmth, or pus), antibiotics may be required. Contrary to popular belief, the fluid in blisters cannot spread the rash to other areas or people. Most cases resolve within 1-3 weeks without scarring.
</document_chunk>
</document_chunks>

**Output:**
Poison ivy rash is a common allergic reaction that affects millions of people each year, causing uncomfortable symptoms that can range from mild irritation to severe inflammation. Fortunately, effective treatment approaches exist for managing this condition at home, with medical intervention available for more serious cases.

### Immediate Steps and Home Treatment

When you first notice a poison ivy rash, immediately wash the affected skin with soap and lukewarm water. This crucial step helps remove any remaining urushiol (the plant oil that causes the reaction) from your skin.

For mild cases, several over-the-counter options can provide relief:
- **Calamine lotion** to soothe irritated skin
- **Hydrocortisone creams (1%)** to reduce inflammation and itching
- **Oral antihistamines** to help control itching
- **Cool compresses** applied for 15-30 minutes several times daily to reduce inflammation

While the rash heals, avoid scratching the affected areas. Scratching can break the skin and lead to infection, potentially complicating your recovery.

### When to Seek Medical Care

For severe or widespread rashes, home treatment may not be sufficient, and medical attention becomes necessary. A healthcare provider may recommend:

- **Prescription-strength corticosteroids**:
  - Topical formulations for limited areas
  - Oral steroids like prednisone for extensive rashes

If you notice signs of infection in the rash area—increased pain, swelling, warmth, or pus—antibiotics may be required to clear the secondary infection.

### Recovery Timeline and Facts

Most poison ivy rashes resolve within 1-3 weeks without scarring. Contrary to what many believe, the fluid in poison ivy blisters cannot spread the rash to other areas of your body or to other people. The spread of the rash is typically due to varying amounts of urushiol on different areas of skin or different times of contact with the plant.

Prompt treatment of poison ivy rash is key to minimizing discomfort and preventing complications. Whether dealing with a mild irritation that responds to home care or a severe reaction requiring medical intervention, understanding the proper treatment approach can significantly reduce recovery time and improve comfort throughout the healing process."""
